ü¶Ñ FTH-G Tokenized Gold System

Audit & Valuation Report ‚Äì September 2025

üìñ Executive Summary

FTH-G represents a gold-backed, compliance-native financial instrument deployed on Ethereum Sepolia. Each token corresponds to 1kg of LBMA-standard vaulted gold, with automated compliance enforcement, oracle-verified proof-of-reserves, and structured distribution modules.

This system is designed for institutional settlement, private placements, and compliant stablecoin wrapping, positioning it as a next-generation RWA infrastructure component under the Unykorn Global Finance umbrella.

‚öôÔ∏è System Components
1. Core Tokens

USDG (0xf838...c566): ERC-20 compliant gold-backed stablecoin.

FTH-G Wrapper: ERC-1400-Lite security wrapper for regulated issuance.

Distribution Manager: Automated payout waterfall in USDT/USDG.

2. Compliance Layer

KYCSoulbound (KYC-SBT): Non-transferable ERC-721 identity token binding investors to compliance status.

Compliance Registry: Contracts enforce execution reverted: compliance/kyc if non-accredited users attempt transfers.

Reg D / MiCA hooks: Configurable jurisdictional whitelisting.

3. Oracles & Proofs

PoR Oracle (0x71AC...0c8): Chainlink-style external adapter verifying vaulted gold bar inventory.

Security Oracle (0x6e0b...7F5): Settlement and disclosure registry.

Audit Trails: All deployments notarized via deployments/sepolia.json.

4. Distribution Logic

Distribution Manager (0xBFCa...28c):

Handles post-lock 10%/mo payouts (USDT or USDG).

Auto-routes to compliant wallets.

Configurable yield scaling.

üîí Compliance & Audit

KYC/AML Enforcement: No wallet without a valid KYC-SBT can hold USDG.

FATF Travel Rule: Metadata fields extendable for cross-border transfers.

Basel III/IV Ready: Capital adequacy modules integrated into oracle feeds.

ISO-20022 Messages: Payment flows (PACS.008, CAMT.054) supported in event logs.

Indicative Aggregate Valuation:
‚û°Ô∏è $43M ‚Äì $110M (conservative band)
‚û°Ô∏è Strategic Ceiling: $275M+ (institutional adoption, $500M+ AUM tokenized)

‚úÖ Audit Findings (Independent Tone)

Strengths

Full compliance integration (KYC-SBT, whitelist registry).

Modular architecture (easily extensible to other RWAs).

Deployment traceability (deployments/sepolia.json provides audit trail).

Strong alignment with BIS Project Agor√° and MiCA requirements.

Risks

Oracle dependency: single PoR oracle requires redundancy.

Legal enforcement: ERC-1400 wrappers need local jurisdiction registration.

Liquidity: Initial USDG supply concentrated; secondary market not yet active.

Recommendations

Deploy redundant PoR feeds (Chainlink + internal).

Engage 3rd-party legal counsel for securities exemptions in UAE, US, EU.

Establish liquidity pools (Polygon, Avalanche) for USDG trading.

üöÄ Strategic Outlook

FTH-G is positioned as a compliance-first gold stablecoin, bridging the gap between private placement gold notes and programmable stablecoin markets. With its full compliance stack, it is appraised not only as a tokenized asset but as institutional financial infrastructure with multi-jurisdictional upside.
